This repository details the statistical analysis conducted to classify and group cars based on their features, aiding in understanding their pricing categories and similarities. Utilizing the comprehensive Automobile dataset from Kaggle, which consists of 203 entries across 26 columns, our analysis focuses on vehicle specifications, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses.

The approach taken in this project involves two key phases:

Random Forest Modeling: I developed a Random Forest model to categorize cars into three price ranges: low, medium, and high. This categorization is
based on various car specifications such as make, model, engine size, and others, derived directly from the dataset.

K-Means Clustering: To identify inherent patterns and natural groupings within the dataset, I applied K-Means clustering. This method was used to explore clusters based on car features, independent of the established price categories.
